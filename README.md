# 2048 on the Web
It is a fork of the original 2048 game and this version is hosted on Github and has no disturbing ads.
<br>
Some fixes and feature changes from other forgotten pull request from the upstream are implemented here.
<br>
<br>
Like my other projects before, I focus on privacy and being ad-free.
<br>
<br>
The game is free to play on https://thedoggybrad.github.io/2048ontheweb/
